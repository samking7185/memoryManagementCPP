# memoryManagementCPP

The memory management C++ application was developed while watching a course on memory management in C++.

The application is a reservation system for a hotel. The goal of the project is to learn different memory management techinques and strategies to avoid common errors.

I've included a Dockerfile to build and launch the application with CMake. I also included some unit-testing with gtest.
